Description: Extract from two-dimensional x-y coordinates of an arm-reaching trajectory, several dependent measures such as area under the curve, latency to start the movement, x-flips, etc.; which characterize the action-dynamics of the response. Mainly developed to analyze data coming from mouse-tracking experiments.
